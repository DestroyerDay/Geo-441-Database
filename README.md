# GEO 441/541 GIS Assignments

This repository contains coursework and projects completed for GEO 441/541 at Miami University. The assignments focus on using ArcGIS Pro and related GIS tools to develop practical skills in mapping, querying, and spatial analysis.

## Topics Covered

- **Basic Mapping**  
  Introductory cartography using ArcGIS Pro, including layout design and map export.
  - Week 1 Assignment: Basic Mapping

    This assignment introduced the ArcGIS Pro interface and basic mapping functions through the creation of three maps: Hugo Roads and Lakes, Cloquet Forestry Center, and Vegetation Polygons. Here is the link to my colab notebook on basic mapping [View the notebook on basic mapping](https://github.com/DestroyerDay/Geo-441-Database/blob/main/Week%201%20Basic%20Mapping.ipynb)
    
  - Week 3 Assignment: Map Projections

    Map projections are methods of transforming the Earth's 3D surface onto a 2D map. Each projection distorts some combination of area, shape, distance, or direction to preserve others, depending on the map's 
    purpose. Here is a link to my colab notebook on map projections [View the notebook on projections](https://github.com/DestroyerDay/Geo-441-Database/blob/main/Week%203%20assignment%3A%20Projections.ipynb)

- **Build Selections and Queries**  
  Creating attribute and spatial queries to select and analyze features in a geodatabase.
  - Week 5 Assignment: Query and Spatial Data 

    This assignment focused on querying spatial and attribute data in ArcGIS Pro. It involved selecting features based on SQL-like conditions and spatial 
    relationships to support geographic analysis.  
    Here is my Colab notebook on query and spatial data [**View the notebook on query and spatial data**](https://github.com/DestroyerDay/Geo-441-Database/blob/main/Week%205%20assignment%3A%20Query%20and%20spatial%20data.ipynb)

- **Spatial Analysis for Vector Data**  
  Performing overlays, buffering, spatial joins, and other vector-based analysis techniques.

- **Spatial Analysis for Raster Data**  
  Working with raster layers to conduct terrain analysis, reclassification, and raster math.

# GEO 441/541 GIS Assignments

This repository contains assignment materials for GEO 441/541 at Miami University. It is organized into five key areas of GIS work:

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Mapping
Foundational map creation and layout using ArcGIS Pro.

## ðŸ”¹ Build Selections and Queries
Attribute- and location-based selection and query building.

## ðŸ”¹ Spatial Analysis for Vector Data
Buffering, overlays, and spatial joins on vector datasets.

## ðŸ”¹ Spatial Analysis for Raster Data
Reclassification, map algebra, and raster-based terrain analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ Web-based Mapping
Creating and sharing maps using ArcGIS Online and web tools.

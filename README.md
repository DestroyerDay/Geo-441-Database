# GEO 441/541 GIS Assignments

This repository contains coursework and projects completed for GEO 441/541 at Miami University. The assignments focus on using ArcGIS Pro and related GIS tools to develop practical skills in mapping, querying, and spatial analysis.

## Topics Covered

- **Basic Mapping**  
  Introductory cartography using ArcGIS Pro, including layout design and map export.
  - Week 1 Assignment: Basic Mapping

    This assignment introduced the ArcGIS Pro interface and basic mapping functions through the creation of three maps: Hugo Roads and Lakes, Cloquet Forestry Center, and Vegetation Polygons. Here is the link to my colab notebook on basic mapping: [View the notebook on basic mapping](https://github.com/DestroyerDay/Geo-441-Database/blob/main/Week%201%20Basic%20Mapping.ipynb)
    
  - Week 3 Assignment: Map Projections

    Map projections are methods of transforming the Earth's 3D surface onto a 2D map. Each projection distorts some combination of area, shape, distance, or direction to preserve others, depending on the map's 
    purpose. Here is a link to my colab notebook on map projections: [View the notebook on projections](https://github.com/DestroyerDay/Geo-441-Database/blob/main/Week%203%20assignment%3A%20Projections.ipynb)

- **Build Selections and Queries**  
  Creating attribute and spatial queries to select and analyze features in a geodatabase.
  - Week 5 Assignment: Query and Spatial Data 

    This assignment focused on querying spatial and attribute data in ArcGIS Pro. It involved selecting features based on SQL-like conditions and spatial 
    relationships to support geographic analysis.  
    Here is my Colab notebook on query and spatial data: [**View the notebook on query and spatial data**](https://github.com/DestroyerDay/Geo-441-Database/blob/main/Week%205%20assignment%3A%20Query%20and%20spatial%20data.ipynb)

- **Spatial Analysis for Vector Data**  
  Performing overlays, buffering, spatial joins, and other vector-based analysis techniques.
  - Week 4 Assignment: Georeferencing
    
    This assignment introduced the process of georeferencing scanned or unreferenced maps by aligning them to real-world coordinates using control points in ArcGIS 
    Pro.  Here is my section on georeferencing:

  - Week 10 Assignment: Spatial Analysis for Vector Data  

    This assignment focused on performing spatial analysis using vector data. Tasks included creating buffers, overlay analysis, and spatial joins to extract and 
    summarize geographic relationships.  
    Here is my section on spatial analysis for vector data: 
    [**View the notebook on vector spatial analysis**](https://github.com/DestroyerDay/Geo-441-Database/blob/main/Week%2010%20assignment%3A%20Spatial%20Analysis%20for%20Vector%20Data.ipynb)

- **Spatial Analysis for Raster Data**  
  Working with raster layers to conduct terrain analysis, reclassification, and raster math.
